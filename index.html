	<h1>Freedom in Chains</h1>
	<h2>By: Chris Marr</h2>
	<p>This is a work in progress (obviously). These lyrics will be copyrighted in the next couple of days. So if you're looking at this page right now, consider yourself extreeeeeemely lucky ;)</p>
	<p>The album you are about to enjoy is a culmination of anger, passion, compassion, loneliness, and overwhelming love... I'm sharing this music not for other people to enjoy (though I truly hope you do enjoy it), I'm sharing this music for myself.</p>
	<p>The poems I've written and the music I've put together is a form of artistic expression that has unparalleled therapeutic emotional and spiritual value to me. They are my way to let the world know how I'm feeling, or how I've felt in the past.</p>
	<p>Music, by nature, is about allowing the listener to step into the artist's shoes for even just a few minutes. So please... Just walk one mile in mine, and let me know how your feet feel afterward :)</p>
	<p>Love you all always.</p>
